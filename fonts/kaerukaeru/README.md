# Kaeru Kaeru

![Image4](documentation/images/RisoPosterScan.png)

Bright colored and blobby shaped patterns of the poison dart frog mixed together with the strangely formed muscles in Japanese woodcuts. Kaeru Kaeru combines both inspirations in one typeface. 

It was created in a seminar called „Type – Inspiration elsewhere“ led by Jérémy Landes at the HfG Karlsruhe. The idea of the seminar was, to take different inspirations out of nature and illustrations and try to combine them to one typeface.
